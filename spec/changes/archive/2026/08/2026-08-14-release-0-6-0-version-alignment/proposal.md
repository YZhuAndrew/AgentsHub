# PromptHub 0.6.0 Version Alignment

## Phase And Status

- Phase: converge
- Status: release-pending
- Primary requirement: `FR-REL-001`
- Exit condition: all product distributions report `0.6.0`, while public
  stable-facing surfaces continue to advertise the latest published stable
  version until `0.6.0` is explicitly promoted to a stable release record.

## Why

PromptHub is beginning the `0.6.0` release line. The monorepo currently reports
`0.5.9` from the root, Desktop, CLI, Web, Worker, and Mobile manifests.

The website release generator previously treated the root package version as an
already-published release. That boundary is now hardened by the related website
stable-metadata change, so this version bump can prepare build artifacts without
advertising nonexistent `0.6.0` downloads.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - align product distribution manifests to `0.6.0`
  - align the project context version in `AGENTS.md`
  - record `0.6.0` as a release preparation
  - keep public stable downloads and badges on the latest explicit stable
    release record
  - verify the explicit public stable release boundary
- Out of scope:
  - creating or pushing a `v0.6.0` tag
  - publishing GitHub Release assets, container images, or package registries
  - changing historical `0.5.9` release records and download history
  - changing the independent private package versions under `packages/*`

## Risks

- A missed product manifest could produce artifacts with inconsistent versions.
- Premature website synchronization could create broken `0.6.0` download links.
- The dirty worktree contains unrelated feature work; release edits must remain
  isolated and must not rewrite those files.

## Rollback Thinking

Before publication, rollback consists of restoring the affected manifests to
`0.5.9`, removing the preparation record, and retaining the existing public
stable metadata. No database, filesystem, or user-data migration is involved.

## Related Records

- Release rules: `spec/releases/release-rules.md`
- Release index: `spec/releases/README.md`
- Previous stable record: `spec/releases/0.5.9.md`
- Website boundary:
  `spec/changes/archive/2026/07/2026-07-30-website-release-metadata-stable-boundary/`

## Archive Note (2026-08-14)

Archived as superseded. The fork stable line moved to 0.7.x and then 0.8.0;
`0.6.0` itself never published as a stable release. Only the historical
`0.6.0-beta.1` prerelease was published (2026-08-13) as a manual-testing
artifact below the stable line. The exit condition "0.6.0 promoted to a
stable release record" is no longer reachable; version alignment is owned by
the fork release line through `spec/releases/0.7.*.md` and
`spec/releases/0.8.0.md`.
