# Release Delta Spec

## Added Requirements

### Requirement: Preview builds must use semver prerelease versions

Desktop preview builds must use semver prerelease versions such as `0.5.6-beta.1` instead of sharing the same plain version number with the eventual stable release.

#### Scenario: Maintainer prepares a desktop preview release

- Given a desktop build intended for prerelease testing
- When the build is packaged and tagged
- Then its app version contains a prerelease component like `beta.N`
- And the corresponding GitHub release is marked as prerelease

#### Scenario: Maintainer republishes a historical beta below stable

- Given a historical preview build previously shared the same plain version as stable
- When the maintainer republishes it as a backfilled prerelease such as `0.5.5-beta.1`
- Then the docs explicitly describe it as a historical beta / manual-download testing build
- And stable-facing download links remain pointed at the stable release `0.5.5`

### Requirement: Installed preview builds default to the preview update lane

Desktop clients running a prerelease app version must default to the preview update lane unless the user explicitly changed the setting before.

#### Scenario: User launches a prerelease desktop build for the first time

- Given the installed app version contains a prerelease component
- And the user has not explicitly chosen a different update lane before
- When PromptHub hydrates settings on startup
- Then the effective update lane defaults to preview

### Requirement: Update checks must never present downgrade candidates as available updates

Desktop update checks must filter out remote versions that are less than or equal to the currently running version.

#### Scenario: Preview build checks the stable lane

- Given a user is running a newer preview build than the latest stable release
- When PromptHub checks for updates
- Then the UI does not show the older stable release as an available update

### Requirement: Preview checks must not depend on missing custom preview manifests

Desktop preview update checks must use a provider / manifest strategy that exists in released artifacts and is covered by CI verification.

#### Scenario: User checks updates on the preview lane

- Given the desktop client is configured for preview updates
- When it checks for updates
- Then it does not request a nonexistent manifest like `preview.yml`
- And CI guarantees the expected update metadata exists for the chosen strategy

### Requirement: Background update checks must not override a visible available-update state

Desktop background update polling must not force the UI back into a transient checking state while the user already has a visible available or downloaded update.

#### Scenario: User has a pending available update in the UI

- Given PromptHub already detected an available update
- When a scheduled background check runs again
- Then the top bar indicator and update dialog do not start flickering between `available` and `checking`

### Requirement: Update dialog content must stay readable within desktop viewport constraints

Desktop update dialogs must keep long release notes and upgrade guidance inside a bounded scrollable content area instead of letting the modal overflow the window.

#### Scenario: User opens an available update with long release notes

- Given PromptHub has detected an available update with markdown release notes
- When the user opens the update dialog
- Then the dialog uses a bounded modal layout that fits within the current desktop viewport
- And release notes scroll inside the content area instead of forcing the whole dialog to overflow

### Requirement: Download-stage UI must not show install-only backup confirmation copy

Desktop update dialogs must keep the `available` state focused on download guidance and reserve install acknowledgement UI for the `downloaded` state where installation can actually start.

#### Scenario: User views an available update before downloading

- Given PromptHub detected an available update that has not been downloaded yet
- When the update dialog renders the `available` state
- Then it may still expose the manual backup shortcut
- But it does not require the installation acknowledgement checkbox or install-only warning copy yet

### Requirement: Homebrew-managed updates must not show in-app install gating

Desktop update dialogs must not show manual-backup install gates for Homebrew-managed builds when the user cannot complete the upgrade inside PromptHub.

#### Scenario: Homebrew user sees an available update

- Given PromptHub is running from a Homebrew-managed installation
- And PromptHub detects an available update
- When the update dialog renders the `available` state
- Then it guides the user to Homebrew / Releases instead of showing the in-app installation backup gate

### `FR-UPDATER-005`: Unsigned direct macOS builds must route to manual DMG download

AgentsHub ships macOS artifacts unsigned (no Apple Developer credentials), so
the native `electron-updater`/Squirrel.Mac swap cannot verify an update (the
project's own history documents this failure). Direct macOS installations must
NOT attempt the in-app ZIP download or native restart. The update dialog must
route the user to download the new DMG manually from the Releases page instead.
Update detection still runs so users learn a new version exists; only the
automated install is replaced by manual DMG guidance. (Supersedes the earlier
"signed direct macOS builds must support in-app updates" intent; the signing it
assumed was never activated for the fork.)

#### Scenario: Direct-install macOS user is offered an update

- Given PromptHub is running from a direct macOS installation rather than Homebrew
- And an update is available
- When the update dialog renders the available or downloaded state
- Then it shows an unsigned-fork notice and an "Open Releases" action
- And it does NOT offer an in-app "Download Update" or "Install Now" native path

#### Scenario: Direct-install macOS update handler short-circuits the native swap

- Given the main process receives an updater download or install request for a direct macOS install
- Then it still creates the pre-upgrade snapshot (install path only)
- And it does NOT call `electron-updater` `downloadUpdate` or `quitAndInstall`
- And it returns a manual result directing the user to the Releases page

#### Scenario: Homebrew macOS user installs a downloaded update

- Given PromptHub is running from a Homebrew Caskroom
- When the user requests an update
- Then PromptHub does not download or replace the application through `electron-updater`
- And it continues to direct the user to Homebrew

### `FR-UPDATER-006`: One manual check must keep one authoritative dialog state

The desktop update dialog must render only updater states produced by the real
main-process check. Development builds may report that update checks are
disabled, but they must not schedule simulated available, not-available, or
downloading states after the user's request.

#### Scenario: Developer opens the update dialog once

- Given PromptHub is running unpackaged in development mode
- When the user clicks Check updates once
- Then one update dialog reports that the development check is unavailable
- And no delayed demo status replaces that result or appears as another update prompt
