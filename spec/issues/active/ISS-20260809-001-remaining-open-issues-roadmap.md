# Remaining Open Issues Roadmap

## Record

- ID: `ISS-20260809-001`
- Status: open
- Last triage update: 2026-08-10
- Source snapshot: `spec/issues/active/github-open.md` dated 2026-08-08
- Local delivery overlay: `spec/issues/active/local-github-status.md`
- Purpose: separate remote GitHub state from actual remaining product work and
  route every unresolved issue to one authoritative change or investigation.

## Current Execution Cut

The current implementation queue starts with the shared database migration
mechanism used by Desktop, CLI, and self-hosted Web. The current source audit has
identified present-tense atomicity, host-order, backup-plan, and compatibility
gaps under `database-migration-safety`; these do not depend on a historical issue
reproducing first.

The #89/#97/#98 audit remains the tagged historical evidence corpus. It verifies
legacy path, backup, and Prompt-history behavior against the redesigned runner,
but it does not define or delay current migration safety work.

## Classification

| Class                                                   | Issues                                      | Local meaning                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current database migration safety                       | #89, #97, #98 as regression evidence        | Active mechanism work under `database-migration-safety`; current defects are addressed independently from historical reproduction.        |
| Current historical audit                                | #89, #97, #98                               | Tagged fixtures under `legacy-upgrade-recovery-audit`; do not claim issue completion before end-to-end evidence.                          |
| Existing correctness work already underway              | #185, #190, #191, #192, #193, #194, #203    | Preserve their current changes and verification gates; do not expand them inside the historical audit.                                    |
| Local design backlog                                    | #44, #74, #195, #196, #197, #198            | Designs are retained and implementation can be scheduled after the historical audit as independently reversible work.                     |
| External or operational dependency backlog              | #15, #27, #92, #106, #132, #177             | Accepted and designed, but not in the current implementation queue.                                                                       |
| Existing local delivery awaiting release/remote closure | #187, #200, #201, #202                      | Confirm the containing public release before changing remote state; the local overlay remains authoritative for delivery status.          |
| Duplicate                                               | #199                                        | Duplicate subset of #198; retain remote state until a public explanation links the canonical issue.                                       |
| Untriaged or support follow-up                          | #64, #71, #79, #107, #139, #141, #145, #188 | Require current reproduction/capability evidence before routing or claiming delivery; broad feedback alone is not an implementation plan. |

## Current Program

| Order | Program                    | Issues          | Authoritative change            | Exit condition                                                                                                       |
| ----- | -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Current migration baseline | Shared SQLite   | `database-migration-safety`     | Empty/current/legacy/partial/newer states and every migration step have executable fixtures.                         |
| 2     | Atomic migration core      | Shared SQLite   | `database-migration-safety`     | Ordered compatibility, transaction rollback, host reconciliation, and safety-point tests pass.                       |
| 3     | Tagged historical corpus   | #89, #97, #98   | `legacy-upgrade-recovery-audit` | Deterministic v0.4.7/v0.4.8/v0.5.1/v0.5.2 path, backup, and Prompt-history fixtures pass through the current runner. |
| 4     | Convergence                | Shared + issues | Both changes                    | Stable migration/recovery docs and local issue evidence match verified restart and rollback behavior.                |

## Local Design Backlog

| Program                     | Issues         | Authoritative change             | Scheduling condition                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace live refresh      | #198, #199     | `desktop-workspace-live-refresh` | Start after historical recovery work; preserve drafts and avoid polling/watchers.           |
| Agent Rules source matrix   | #196, #197     | `rules-agent-source-matrix`      | Start when official/versioned source evidence is assembled.                                 |
| Prompt workspace completion | #44, #74, #195 | `prompt-workspace-completion`    | Ship the three tracks independently; multi-message storage requires its own migration gate. |

Existing work for #185, #190 through #194, and #203 keeps its own active change,
tests, and convergence gates. This roadmap does not merge those changes into the
historical audit or declare them paused/completed.

## Deferred Dependency Backlog

| Program                      | Issues     | Authoritative change                  | Reason for deferral                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows trust and signing    | #92        | `windows-code-signing-and-reputation` | Requires protected certificate/provider setup and clean Windows release infrastructure.             |
| Mobile WebDAV distribution   | #15        | `mobile-webdav-distribution`          | Requires Android/iOS packaging, secure mobile credentials, and store/device verification.           |
| Collaborative Prompt sharing | #106       | `cloud-collaborative-prompt-sharing`  | Requires a server-owned workspace, ACL, audit, and conflict service rather than a local-only patch. |
| Marketplace expansion        | #132, #177 | `marketplace-expansion`               | Requires verified external contracts and must not rely on guessed endpoints or scraping.            |
| Git backup transports        | #27        | `git-backup-transports`               | Requires remote credentials, encrypted snapshot transport, and GitHub/Gitee integration evidence.   |

These changes remain design records so their data, security, and compatibility
boundaries are not lost. `accepted` means valid backlog work, not implementation
in progress.

## Shared Architecture Decisions

1. PromptHub-owned libraries, SQLite rows, or managed workspaces are canonical;
   Agent files, caches, views, and remote transports are projections.
2. Version history, whole-product backup, online synchronization, target write
   recovery, and legacy upgrade recovery are distinct concepts.
3. Shared SQLite compatibility uses one ordered manifest; host filesystem
   reconciliation is not recorded as a schema migration.
4. External mutations use validate, stage, atomic publish, verify, and rollback.
5. Inventories use pagination, lazy detail loading, bounded traversal, and
   finite concurrency. No unbounded watcher, cache, retry loop, or scan is
   allowed.
6. New platform paths and third-party protocols require official documentation
   or a versioned executable fixture. A plausible directory name is not proof.
7. Each active change maintains `FR -> DES -> TEST -> T` traceability and remains
   open until implementation, verification, documentation, issue state, and
   release state converge.

## Sequencing

1. Build the current shared SQLite migration fixture and failure-injection matrix.
2. Implement ordered compatibility, atomic migration, managed safety points,
   host reconciliation, and the Desktop stage coordinator.
3. Run the #89/#97/#98 historical fixtures through the verified mechanism.
4. Converge migration/recovery evidence and stable documentation.
5. Resume independently reversible local backlog work.
6. Schedule signing, mobile, collaboration, marketplace, and Git transports
   only when their external credentials, protocols, and test environments are
   available.

## Non-Goals

- Closing GitHub issues merely because a design exists locally.
- Treating a prerelease tag as a stable public release without publication
  evidence.
- Combining all remaining issues into one implementation branch or commit.
- Replacing existing active changes that already own the same user problem.
- Keeping external-dependency work marked `in_progress` when only its design is
  complete.
